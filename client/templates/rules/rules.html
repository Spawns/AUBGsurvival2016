                <h3>General</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Every participant is a hunter and a victim at the same time</li>
                    <li>Every player in the game is assigned a personal code</li>
                	<li>The victim will be considered "killed" only after the hunter says "You are my victim and you are killed" to his/her victim.</li>
                    <li>Once having said that, the killer needs to get the victim’s personal code, embed it into the website and press the “kill” button</li>
                    <li>The system will then automatically generate a new victim for you and the same procedure goes with the new victim.</li>
                    <li>The deadline of the game is April 23rd, midnight, 00.00. That is, the whole process of hunting and killing will be effective till that time only. The system will NOT be accepting your “kills” following the deadline.</li>
                    <li> there are two people left in the game before the deadline, the game can stop at that moment and you will be notified.</li>
                    <li>The winners of the game are the first kill and the three people with the most kills. Prizes will be announced shortly after the end of the game!</li>
                    <li>A system gives you an access to the full list of the players you have killed, ranking and rules.</li>
                    <li>If there are any misunderstandings or conflicts unresolved between the killer and the victim - contact Dinara Zhubaniyaz asap through Facebook, dnz120@aubg.edu or any RA at the front desk in Skapto 2</li>

                <ol>
                    <li> The process of "killing" should take place only in CLOSED SPACES, like lobbies, elevators or halls, so that nobody can "testify" about the murder</li>
                    <li>Possible places for murders are rooms, corridors, lobbies (if there is no one but you and your victim), stairs, elevators, balconies</li>
                    <li>A winner is not necessarily the one who survived. Whoever has the most number of skills, regardless of them being alive or not, has a chance to win.</li>
                    <li>The "killer" cannot "kill" the victim in the presence of another person. In case a third person watched the crime scene, the target is still in the game.</li>
                    <li>Once "killed", the victim is out of the game (but still can be considered as a potential winner)</li>
                    <li>People, who fail to comply with the rules will be automatically disqualified.</li>
                    <li>A victim cannot run away/scream/call for help whenever the "killer" starts saying "you are my victim...."</li>
                    <li>If someone pops up in the "crime scene" AFTER the killer said "you are my victim and you are killed" - the murder still COUNTS</li>
                    <li>Every participant has to kill the victim by himself!</li>
                    <li>If any player is suspicious about someone breaking the rules, he/she can always contact Dinara Zhubaniyaz through dnz120@aubg.bg or Facebook page</li>
